# note_app

#### screens of application 
Developed a simple and easy-to-use way app to take, organize, and share notes. It is perfect for students, professionals, and
anyone who needs to keep track of their thoughts and ideas.
###

• Used Bloc to manage the state of the application.
• Used Hive to store data locally on the device, even when the app is offline.
• Used MVVM to separate the UI, view logic, and business logic of the app, making it easier to maintain and test.
